== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't the data send to spreadsheet? Elementor Submit is just Spinning. = 
Sometimes it can take a while of spinning before it goes through. But if the entries never show up in your Sheet then one of these things might be the reason:

1. Wrong access code ( Check debug log )
2. Wrong Sheet name or tab name
3. Wrong Column name mapping ( keep in mind that not to use capital letters, number as initial and special characters like underscores, double or single code, space etc. You can only use small letters and hyphen. )

Please double-check those items and hopefully getting them right will fix the issue.
